# Testing guide

See the [Django Docs page for Writing and Running Tests](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/testing/overview/)

All test files must be in this directory

For test discovery, all tests must be named following `test_*.py` (eg. `test_orders.py`)

Tests should import TestCase from django.test

Every test file has a class that takes TestCase as an input

The test case class should have a useful docstring

In the test case class, there may be a setUp function that creates the required objects to be used by all tests in this file

Tests are further divided into functions. Each function will typically test a different feature. There should be at least 1 assert per test function.

Tests can be executed with `sudo docker exec -it lims_web_server python manage.py test tests/`

## Coverage

 Coverage is extremely useful for showing where more tests are needed.
 
  1. To use the coverage library, access a bash terminal in the container and run `coverage run manage.py test tests/`.
  2. Export it to an html document by running `coverage html`.
  3. Copy the report output out to the host machine by running `docker cp lims_web_Server/src/htmlcov .`. This command needs to be run on the host machine.
  4. Navigate to `index.html` in `html_cov/` and open it in a browser.
