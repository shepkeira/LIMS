# 10-08 Client Meeting Notes

- Prof is okay with sharing the database schema, so Matt Borle from LIMS(1) shared a schema for the teams to use. We will work together to refine it over time
- Meetings with the client have been moved from Friday at 4pm to Monday at 4pm. Due to Thanksgiving, this week only we will meet tuesday
- Midju (client rep from QHR) will communicate recommended encryption methods and security measures.
- We do not have to account for human clinical trials which have intense regulations surrounding them. We only need to worry about commercial lab work that is non-human based.
- Lukman (client rep from lab) will provide user stories from the perspective of receiving lab and customer. He will also provide sample input data from a client and how it changes along the workflow of a lab.
